# ECSE321 Group 20

This team project for ECSE321 2019 is a tutoring company software and website. Through this company, we cater to the needs of students at the high school, CÃ‰GEP, and university levels. Any student looking for a tutor in any subject taught at those levels can approach the company and ask its help to find an appropriate tutor. Our view point is the tutor view point.
