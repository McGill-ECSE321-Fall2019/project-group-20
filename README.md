# ECSE321 Group 20

This team project for ECSE321 2019 is a tutoring company software and website. Through this company, we cater to the needs of students at the high school, CÃ‰GEP, and university levels. Any student looking for a tutor in any subject taught at those levels can approach the company and ask its help to find an appropriate tutor. Our view point is the tutor view point. 

## Sprint 1 - Requirements, Domain Modeling, and Database Design
  - The domain model was made with UMLLab and can be found under the `UML` folder.
  - The use cases and requirements for the functional and non-functional requirements are in the `Requirements` folder. 
  - The database design has been generated using Postgres, which can be found in the `Database` folder.
  - Test cases with Travis CI and Gradle were instanciated each time a build was created, and can be found in the `Test` folder.
