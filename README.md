This team project for ECSE321 2019 is a tutoring company software and website. Through this company, we cater to the needs of students at the high school, CÉGEP, and university levels. Any student looking for a tutor in any subject taught at those levels can approach the company and ask its help to find an appropriate tutor. Our view point is the tutor view point. 

The first stable backend version deployed to heroku as a SpringBoot application can be found on https://ecse321-group20-2020.herokuapp.com/
