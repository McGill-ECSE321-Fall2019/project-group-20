HEROKU LINK : https://ecse321-group20-2020.herokuapp.com/

For developement purposes, you can run `heroku local web` to see the application in the local servers.

This team project for ECSE321 2019 is a tutoring company software and website. Through this company, we cater to the needs of students at the high school, CÃ‰GEP, and university levels. Any student looking for a tutor in any subject taught at those levels can approach the company and ask its help to find an appropriate tutor. Our view point is the tutor view point. 

The first stable backend version deployed to heroku as a SpringBoot application can be found on https://ecse321-group20-2020.herokuapp.com/ 

You can add to the url with the restful mapping to see the data as JSON objects. The url links are explained in the [Restful services wiki page.](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2019/project-group-20/wiki/RESTful-Service-Endpoints)
